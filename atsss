MA PDU session establish -> PCF -> MA control policy -> communication between UE and UPF
MA control polifcy -> SMF -> generate steering policy for UE and UPF

what is in the steering rules
Rule identity
Rule precedence
Traffic descriptor
        application identity : com.example.app1
        porotocol : TCP
Access steering descriptor
        steering functionality : MPTCP
        steering mode : Load bal
        Steering mode info : 50 percent over 3gpp and 50 percent over non-3gpp
        threshold values : max-RTT = 20us


for TCP flows -> MPTCP
non TCP flows(UDP) -> ATSSS-LL(does not apply multi path protocol only scheduler sends packet to one of the two accesses)

ATSSS-LL 
layer-2 multi-access mechanism
ethernet type PDU session - only mechanism in ATSSS (MAC layer PDU)
if PDU is IPv4/IPv6 - ATSSS-LL complements MPTCP (Network layer PDU)

Rules are based on Policy measurement function(PMF) policy

MPQSF - Multi-Path QUIC(MPQUIC) Steering Functionality

1. establish MA PDU session
2. now UE establishes one or more QUIC connections with UPF -> each with diff QoS requirement

MPQSF in UE has two IP address one for each access type - given during PDU session - while UPF MPQSF has only one(MPQUIC proxy IP)

Components of MPQSF
QoS flow selection and steering mode selection
        establishment of QUIC connections after establishment of
